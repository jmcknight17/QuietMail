Welcome to QuietMail! 
This is a web app aimed to help you freshen up and clear out any unnecessary junk from your inbox. The goal is to give you full control through mass email deletion, easy unsubscribing, and detailed analytics, all while keeping your data security at the forefront.

Why I'm Building This
I first got this idea when I was scrolling through my personal inbox and noticed I had a staggering 37,000 unread emails. I knew this was an issue, but I didn't even know where to start.

So, I went looking for existing solutions, and honestly, I wasn't impressed. I saw some aesthetic and functional apps, often at a low cost, but after digging a little deeper, I realized many of them were harvesting user data to sell to third parties.

For QuietMail, data privacy is the number one priority. I believe you shouldn't have to trade your privacy for a clean inbox. Your data will never be sold to third parties. 
The app will never read the contents of your emails; it only looks at the header, sender, and status (read/unread) to produce detailed analytics for you. That's it.

This project is a work in progress, and I'm building it in public. If you have any feedback on the code or the application itself, I'd love to hear from you.
